# Easy Crypto Challenge

## Description

My slingshotter cousin Maneo just discovered a new cryptography scheme and has been raving about it since. I was trying to tell him the importance of setting a **large, random** private key, but he wouldn't listen. Guess security isn't as important as how many thousands of credits he can win in his next race around the system.

I've recovered a message sent to him detailing the finish line. Can you decrypt the message to find the coordinates so I can beat him there? I'll give you a percentage of the score!

**Enter flag as shctf{x_y}**, where x & y are the coordinates of the decrypted point.
